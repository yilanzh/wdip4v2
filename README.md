#WDI Project 4: Lookup html structure 

## Tools and Packages
* node.js
* express: setup server
* ejs: view engine
* request: get remote file
* cheerio: similar to jQuery
* nodemon: server auto refresh

## Issues
* Unable to pass data from request to public variable. Therefore two views were used to show link and result.
* How to nest the code so that second request can use result from the first request.
* More work required to obtain useful data from saved JSON file


## Tools tried
* hbs and express-handlebars
* express generator
* body-parser

## Next
* Work with more than one remote location
* Use JSON to store and retrieve data
* Use database to store and update view
* Populate visual content
* Add test
